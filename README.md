# Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize emotions in facial images. It detects facial expressions and associates them with one of the following emotions: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised.
The emotion recognition model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is capable of classifying emotions into seven categories.
It can detect facial expressions or emotions both from image inputs and video inputs
